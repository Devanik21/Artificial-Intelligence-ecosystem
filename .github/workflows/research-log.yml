            "Reflected on cross-project consistency of internal state representations and whether shared abstractions are emerging organically."
            "Reviewed alignment between metric-driven development practices and the stated objective of scalable internal self-model estimation."
            "Examined whether recent architectural experiments implicitly assume stationarity where none is guaranteed."
            "Documented tensions between exploratory architectural breadth and the need for deeper longitudinal validation."
            "Re-evaluated the role of information-theoretic metrics as primary optimization targets rather than post-hoc analysis tools."
            "Considered failure modes where emergent behaviors may be artifacts of training protocol rather than structural necessity."
            "Reviewed assumptions about reversibility and modularity across experimental architectures to avoid premature lock-in."
            "Clarified distinctions between representational richness and actionable self-model fidelity."
            "Identified areas where control-theoretic guarantees are currently absent and must precede further scaling."
            "Reflected on the balance between biological inspiration and mathematical tractability in current designs."
            "Reviewed whether causal emergence claims remain intervention-robust under alternative decompositions."
            "Documented open questions regarding the measurement of integrated information in large, non-Markovian systems."
            "Considered whether recent agentic behaviors reflect genuine internal modeling or shallow policy correlations."
            "Reassessed evaluation protocols to ensure they do not implicitly encode desired outcomes."
            "Noted conceptual gaps between theoretical framing and implementation-level constraints."
            "Recorded uncertainty around generalization of observed behaviors across domains and task families."
            "Reviewed whether exploratory results justify additional complexity or call for simplification."
            "Clarified which observed dynamics are hypotheses versus validated properties."
            "Identified candidate directions for unifying disparate projects under a shared formal framework."
            "Reaffirmed the priority of interpretability and controllability over raw performance metrics."
