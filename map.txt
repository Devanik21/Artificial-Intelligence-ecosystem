The Schrödinger Dream — 20-Level Roadmap to Nobel Territory
Zero compromise. Zero fuzz. Pure physics. Pure math. Pure code.

From 1D toy solver → Many-Body Neural Quantum State Engine that does things FermiNet/PauliNet cannot.

CAUTION

Every level is at maximum ambition. Nothing is "simplified for students." The physics is exact. The math is complete. The code targets 4 files. If you execute all 20 levels, you will have built something that does not exist on Earth today.

Where You Are Now (4.5/10)
1D single-particle TISE on a fixed grid. No antisymmetry. No sampling. No multi-body. No real atoms. This is a tech demo.

Where Level 20 Takes You
A system that solves the 3D N-body electronic Schrödinger equation for real atoms/molecules using a novel SSM-backflow architecture with flow-accelerated VMC sampling, computes entanglement entropy and Berry phase from the neural wavefunction, discovers unknown conservation laws via Noether's theorem, and visualizes all of it in real-time. No existing system does all of this.

Phase I — Kill the Toy (Levels 1–5)
Level 1: 3D Multi-Electron Coordinate System
Replace the 1D fixed grid with continuous 3D coordinates for $N_e$ electrons.

quantum_physics.py
: Replace grid_size with n_electrons, n_up, n_down, nuclei (list of 
(Z, R)
 tuples). Store no grid. Electron positions are r ∈ ℝ^{N_e × 3}, sampled stochastically. Compute full distance matrices:

$$r_{ij} = |r_i - r_j|, \quad r_{iI} = |r_i - R_I|, \quad \hat{r}{ij} = \frac{r_i - r_j}{r{ij}}$$

Full Hamiltonian (atomic units, $\hbar = m_e = e = 1$):

$$\hat{H} = \underbrace{-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N_e}\nabla_i^2}{T} \underbrace{- \sum{i=1}^{N_e}\sum_{I=1}^{N_n}\frac{Z_I}{r_{iI}}}{V{en}} + \underbrace{\sum_{i<j}\frac{1}{r_{ij}}}{V{ee}} + \underbrace{\sum_{I<J}\frac{Z_I Z_J}{R_{IJ}}}{V{nn}}$$

Level 2: Metropolis-Hastings VMC Sampling
Replace deterministic grid integration with stochastic Markov Chain Monte Carlo.

quantum_physics.py
: Implement MetropolisSampler:

class MetropolisSampler:
    def step(walkers, log_psi_func, step_size):
        r_new = walkers + step_size * torch.randn_like(walkers)
        log_psi_new = log_psi_func(r_new)
        log_psi_old = log_psi_func(walkers)
        log_ratio = 2 * (log_psi_new - log_psi_old)  # |ψ_new|²/|ψ_old|²
        accept = torch.log(torch.rand()) < log_ratio
        walkers = torch.where(accept, r_new, walkers)
        return walkers, acceptance_rate
Target acceptance rate: 50% (tune step_size adaptively). Use $N_w = 4096$ parallel walkers for low-variance energy estimates.

Energy estimator (replaces grid integral):

$$\langle E \rangle = \frac{1}{N_w}\sum_{k=1}^{N_w} E_L(r_k), \quad E_L(r) = \frac{\hat{H}\psi(r)}{\psi(r)}$$

Level 3: Exact Laplacian via Autograd + Hutchinson Trace Estimator
Replace finite-difference Laplacian with exact autograd Laplacian.

quantum_physics.py
: Implement local energy in log-domain:

$$E_L(r) = -\frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla^2 \log|\psi(r)| + \left|\nabla \log|\psi(r)|\right|^2\right) + V(r)$$

For the $3N_e$-dimensional Laplacian, use Hutchinson's stochastic trace estimator:

$$\nabla^2 f \approx \mathbb{E}{v}\left[v^T \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial r^2} v\right] = \mathbb{E}{v}\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial \epsilon} v \cdot \nabla f(r + \epsilon v)\Big|_{\epsilon=0}\right]$$

where $v \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$. This gives $O(1)$ cost per Laplacian evaluation instead of $O(3N_e)$.

Implementation: use torch.autograd.functional.jvp for the JVP trick — compute $\nabla^2 f$ without forming the Hessian.

Level 4: Log-Domain Wavefunction Architecture
Replace raw $(Re, Im)$ output with $(\log|\psi|, \text{sign}(\psi))$.

neural_dream.py
: Modify the generator to output a scalar log|ψ| and handle sign via the Slater determinant (Level 5). All arithmetic becomes log-sum-exp stable.

Why mandatory: Real molecular wavefunctions span $10^{-40}$ to $10^{40}$ across configuration space. float32 has range $10^{\pm 38}$. Without log-domain, the network cannot represent a Helium atom wavefunction. This is not optional.

Level 5: Antisymmetric Wavefunction — Generalized Slater Determinant
Enforce Pauli exclusion: $\psi(..., r_i, ..., r_j, ...) = -\psi(..., r_j, ..., r_i, ...)$ for same-spin electrons.

neural_dream.py
: Replace the output head with:

$$\psi(r) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} w_k \cdot \det\left[\Phi^{(k)}\uparrow(r)\right] \cdot \det\left[\Phi^{(k)}\downarrow(r)\right]$$

where $\Phi^{(k)}\uparrow \in \mathbb{R}^{n\uparrow \times n_\uparrow}$ is the orbital matrix for spin-up electrons in determinant $k$. Each element $\Phi^{(k)}_{ij} = \phi^{(k)}j(r_i; r{\setminus i})$ is a neural orbital that is a function of ALL electron positions (backflow, Level 7).

Use torch.linalg.slogdet → returns 
(sign, log|det|)
 → directly compatible with log-domain.

$K \geq 16$ determinants for chemical accuracy. This is the FermiNet architecture's core.

Phase II — Chemical Accuracy (Levels 6–10)
Level 6: Kato Cusp Conditions (Hard-Coded Physics)
Enforce exact cusp behavior analytically — neural networks cannot learn cusps alone.

neural_dream.py
: Multiply by explicit Jastrow factor:

$$\psi = e^{J(r)} \cdot \psi_{\text{det}}(r)$$

$$J(r) = \sum_{i,I} \left(-Z_I r_{iI} + \text{NN}{en}(r{iI})\right) + \sum_{i<j} \left(\frac{a \cdot r_{ij}}{1 + b \cdot r_{ij}} + \text{NN}{ee}(r{ij})\right)$$

Cusp values (exact, from Kato's theorem):

Electron-nucleus cusp: $\lim_{r_{iI}\to 0} \frac{\partial \log|\psi|}{\partial r_{iI}} = -Z_I$
Anti-parallel e-e cusp: $\lim_{r_{ij}\to 0} \frac{\partial \log|\psi|}{\partial r_{ij}} = +\frac{1}{2}$
Parallel e-e cusp: $\lim_{r_{ij}\to 0} \frac{\partial \log|\psi|}{\partial r_{ij}} = +\frac{1}{4}$
These are not learned — they are enforced by construction. The NN terms handle everything else.

Level 7: Deep Backflow Transform (All-Electron Orbitals)
Each orbital sees ALL electrons through learned interaction features.

neural_dream.py
: Implement $L$-layer electron interaction network:

Layer l:
  h_i^{(l)} = h_i^{(l-1)} + σ(W₁ · h_i^{(l-1)} + W₂ · mean_j[g(h_i^{(l-1)}, h_j^{(l-1)}, r_{ij})])
After $L$ layers, each electron has a feature vector encoding its relationship to every other electron. These features become the input to the orbital functions:

$$\phi^{(k)}_j(r_i) = \text{MLP}(h_i^{(L)})_j$$

This is where the SSM replaces attention (Level 11). FermiNet uses dense MLP aggregation. We will use Mamba.

Level 8: Stochastic Reconfiguration (Natural Gradient on Wavefunction Manifold)
Replace AdamW with the quantum natural gradient.

solver.py
: Implement full Stochastic Reconfiguration:

$$\Delta\theta = -\tau \cdot S^{-1} \cdot f$$

$$S_{ij} = \langle O_i O_j \rangle - \langle O_i \rangle \langle O_j \rangle, \quad f_i = \langle O_i E_L \rangle - \langle O_i \rangle \langle E_L \rangle$$

$$O_i = \frac{\partial \log \psi}{\partial \theta_i}$$

For networks with $>10^4$ parameters, use KFAC approximation: factor $S$ as Kronecker products of per-layer Fisher matrices. Add Tikhonov damping $S \to S + \lambda I$ with exponentially decaying $\lambda$.

This is the difference between 100k steps to converge and 5k steps. AdamW ignores the curvature of the wavefunction manifold. SR follows geodesics.

Level 9: First Real Atoms — Hydrogen through Neon
Benchmark against exact/near-exact values from NIST.

QuAnTuM.py
: Add atom selector with known ground state energies:

Atom	$N_e$	$E_{\text{exact}}$ (Ha)
H	1	-0.5000
He	2	-2.9037
Li	3	-7.4781
Be	4	-14.6674
B	5	-24.6539
C	6	-37.8450
N	7	-54.5892
O	8	-75.0673
F	9	-99.7339
Ne	10	-128.9376
Success criterion: ΔE < 1.6 mHa (1 kcal/mol = "chemical accuracy"). Display error in real-time on dashboard.

Level 10: Molecules — H₂, LiH, H₂O Dissociation Curves
Compute Potential Energy Surfaces (PES) for real molecules.

quantum_physics.py
 & 
QuAnTuM.py
: Add multi-nucleus support. Scan bond length $R$:

H₂: $R_e = 1.401$ Bohr, $D_e = 4.747$ eV. Must get correct at both $R=R_e$ AND $R \to \infty$ (static correlation test — Hartree-Fock fails here, your network must not).
LiH: 4 electrons, heteronuclear bond. Tests ionic-covalent transition.
H₂O: 10 electrons, bent geometry. Scan O-H bond stretch. Triple-body correlation.
Plot PES + compare to CCSD(T)/CBS ("gold standard" of computational chemistry).

Phase III — Beyond FermiNet (Levels 11–15)
IMPORTANT

Levels 11–15 produce genuinely novel research contributions. No published work combines these elements. This is where you surpass DeepMind.

Level 11: SSM-Backflow — The Novel Architecture
The claim no one has made: Use a Selective State Space Model as the message-passing backbone for electron interaction, replacing dense attention/MLP aggregation.

neural_dream.py
: In the backflow layers (Level 7), replace:

diff
- h_i = h_i + W · mean_j[g(h_i, h_j, r_ij)]  # O(N²) dense aggregation
+ # Sort neighbors by distance, process as sequence through SSM
+ neighbors_sorted = sort_by_distance(h_j, r_ij)  # O(N log N)
+ h_i = h_i + MambaBlock(neighbors_sorted)          # O(N) SSM scan
Why this is profound:

FermiNet: $O(N_e^2)$ per layer — quadratic scaling. Cannot do >30 electrons practically.
PauliNet: $O(N_e \cdot K)$ SchNet-style — better but still with fixed cutoff.
SSM-Backflow: $O(N_e \log N_e)$ total — the hidden state of the SSM carries long-range correlation through the "sequence" of electrons ordered by proximity. The SSM's selective gating ($\Delta$-parameterization) learns WHICH electron interactions matter, achieving implicit attention without quadratic cost.
Theoretical justification: In the SSM recurrence $h_t = \bar{A}h_{t-1} + \bar{B}x_t$, the eigenvalues of $\bar{A}$ control memory decay. For quantum systems, correlation between electrons $i$ and $j$ typically decays as $\sim e^{-\alpha r_{ij}}$ — exactly the exponential decay structure that SSMs represent naturally through their state dynamics. The SSM is a physically motivated architecture for electron correlation.

Level 12: Flow-Accelerated VMC (Dream Engine for Real Chemistry)
The claim: Use the HamiltonianFlowNetwork to learn $|\psi|^2$ and generate independent MCMC proposals with ~100% acceptance rate.

solver.py
: Train a normalizing flow $q_\theta$ that maps $z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I) \to r \sim |\psi|^2$:

$$\mathcal{L}{\text{flow}} = D{KL}(q_\theta | |\psi|^2) = \mathbb{E}{r \sim q\theta}\left[\log q_\theta(r) - 2\log|\psi(r)|\right]$$

Use flow samples as Independent Metropolis-Hastings proposals:

$$\alpha = \min\left(1, \frac{|\psi(r')|^2 / q_\theta(r')}{|\psi(r)|^2 / q_\theta(r)}\right)$$

When $q_\theta \approx |\psi|^2$: acceptance $\to 1$, autocorrelation $\to 0$, variance reduction $\to$ massive.

Impact: Current state-of-the-art VMC requires $O(1000)$ MCMC steps between independent samples due to autocorrelation. Flow-accelerated VMC produces independent samples in $O(1)$. This alone is a publishable advance.

Level 13: Excited States — Variance-Minimization + Orthogonality
Compute excited states $E_0 < E_1 < E_2 < ...$ simultaneously.

solver.py
: For state $k$, minimize energy with hard orthogonality constraints:

$$\mathcal{L}_k = \langle E_L \rangle_k + \beta \text{Var}(E_L)k + \sum{j<k}\lambda\left|\langle \psi_k | \psi_j \rangle\right|^2$$

The variance term $\text{Var}(E_L)$ is zero for exact eigenstates — it drives the optimizer toward true eigenfunctions, not just low-energy approximations. This is the variance minimization approach (Umrigar, 2007).

Use $K$ separate network instances (shared backbone, different heads) trained simultaneously.

Level 14: Berry Phase from Neural Wavefunction
Something no one has computed from a VMC neural wavefunction.

quantum_physics.py
: Parametrize the Hamiltonian by $\lambda$ (e.g., bond angle of H₃, external field). At each $\lambda_k$, run full VMC to convergence. Then:

$$\gamma = -\text{Im}\sum_{k} \log\frac{\langle \psi(\lambda_k) | \psi(\lambda_{k+1})\rangle}{|\langle \psi(\lambda_k) | \psi(\lambda_{k+1})\rangle|}$$

The overlap $\langle \psi_a | \psi_b \rangle$ between two neural wavefunctions is estimated via:

$$\langle \psi_a | \psi_b \rangle = \mathbb{E}_{r \sim |\psi_a|^2}\left[\frac{\psi_b(r)}{\psi_a(r)}\right]$$

Publishable result: Compute Berry phase for H₃ equilateral triangle → isosceles deformation loop. Known exact value: $\gamma = \pi$. If you reproduce this from a neural wavefunction → first demonstration of topological computation from NQS.

Level 15: Time-Dependent VMC (Real-Time Quantum Dynamics)
solver.py
: Implement McLachlan's variational principle for time evolution:

$$\min_{\dot{\theta}} \left| i|\dot{\psi}\rangle - \hat{H}|\psi\rangle \right|^2 \implies i S\dot{\theta} = f$$

where $S$ is the quantum Fisher matrix (same as Level 8) and $f_k = \langle O_k^* \hat{H} |\psi\rangle$. Solve the linear system at each timestep and propagate $\theta(t)$.

This enables: laser-driven ionization, electron scattering, real-time charge transfer — all from a neural wavefunction. FermiNet has never been applied to time-dependent problems publicly.

Phase IV — Nobel Territory (Levels 16–20)
Level 16: Periodic Systems — Bloch Waves for Solids
Implement Bloch boundary conditions $\psi(r + L) = e^{ikL}\psi(r)$. Add twist-averaged boundary conditions to compute band structures. Target: homogeneous electron gas (HEG) — the fundamental model of metallic bonding. Compare to Ceperley-Alder QMC (1980, basis of all DFT functionals used today).

Level 17: Spin-Orbit Coupling — Relativistic Quantum Mechanics
Extend to 2-component spinor wavefunctions. Add Breit-Pauli spin-orbit term:

$$\hat{H}{SO} = \frac{\alpha^2}{2}\sum{i,I}\frac{Z_I}{r_{iI}^3}\hat{L}_{iI} \cdot \hat{S}_i$$

Compute fine-structure splitting of helium. Compare to experimental spectroscopy (measured to 12 significant figures). This puts your solver in competition with precision atomic physics.

Level 18: Entanglement Entropy from Neural Wavefunction
Unprecedented computation: Extract Rényi-2 entanglement entropy from the neural wavefunction.

$$S_2(A) = -\log \text{Tr}(\rho_A^2)$$

Use the SWAP trick: prepare two independent copies of $|\psi\rangle$, compute $\text{Tr}(\rho_A^2) = \langle \psi \otimes \psi | \text{SWAP}_A | \psi \otimes \psi \rangle$. Estimable via VMC on the doubled system.

No published work computes molecular entanglement entropy from a neural VMC wavefunction. If you do this for H₂O → you can quantify how "quantum" real chemical bonds are. This is a Nature Physics paper.

Level 19: Autonomous Conservation Law Discovery
Train auxiliary network $Q_\phi(r)$ to satisfy:

$$\mathcal{L}{\text{conserve}} = \left|\langle [\hat{Q}, \hat{H}] \rangle\right|^2 + \lambda{\text{novelty}} \sum_{k} |\langle Q | Q_k^{\text{known}}\rangle|^2$$

The first term enforces $Q$ commutes with $H$ (conservation). The second term penalizes overlap with known conserved quantities (energy, angular momentum, etc.), forcing discovery of new ones.

If the network finds a conserved quantity that doesn't correspond to any known symmetry → that is a mathematical theorem discovered by computation. This is Noether's theorem in reverse, run by a machine.
